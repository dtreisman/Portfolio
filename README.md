## [Batting Order Optimization in R](https://github.com/dtreisman/Baseball-Simulation-in-R)

* Comparison of several batting order strategies based on real batting statistics of the Chicago Cubs 2018 most used batting order (according to baseball-reference.com)
  + Original Order
  + Pitcher batting 8th (common approach to stimulate more offensive production)
  + Pitcher batting 1st (is it that bad?) 
  + Lineup consiting of the same batter throughout for each batter
  + 6th batter (Schwarber) batting first
  + Optimized order through simulation
  + Lineup based on On Base Percentage (decreasing)
